== Inline templates
Is it possible to inline template attributes? We want attributes.

== Models
x Abstract models
x Subclassing not complete
Change to name 'category'
Check subclassing

== API
x deletes to be enabled
Reparent_choices is a mess

== Admin
x indent title column rename
x invert chars
x Needs abstracting for model
Auto-slug

== Admin forms
Optional categorisation
Term parents displaying the null option badly as '-1'
Term element, Term parents - no verification term exists.

Humm. Verification (for what?) not hard to add.


== objects
Unpublishing

== Rendering
Why are displays sometimes hanging?

== SVGs
Can make relative sizing?

== Tests
!!!

== Other
Auto-slug code
Do builtins work in packaging?
