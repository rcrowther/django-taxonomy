== Inline templates
Is it possible to inline template attributes? We want attributes.

== Models
Change to name 'category'
Check subclassing

== Admin
x indent title column rename
Needs abstracting for model
Auto-slug
Want the tree as tree (or root), or upend the visual prefix?

== Admin forms
Optional categorisation
Term parents displaying the null option badly as '-1'
Term element, Term parents - no verification term exists.

Humm. Verification (for what?) not hard to add.

Validate tree_id never chages for a term.

== objects
Unpublishing

== API
deletes to be enabled
Reparent_choices is a mess

== Rendering
Why are dispalys sometimes hanging?

== SVGs
Can make relative sizing?

== Models
x Abstract models
Get rid of slugs, they're for abstraction
Reverse lookups

== Other
Auto-slug code
